Notes
=====

- The driver used is chromedriver.exe, but in the same folder is the driver for Firefox.
To use it we just need to change the line:

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", resourceFolder + "/chromedriver.exe"); to

System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.driver", resourceFolder + "/geckodriver.exe");

- The other .jar in the folder is used in case we can add functionality to the driver if it doesn't work.
It's needed to open a cmd in the folder of the installation and run the jar as 
java -jar webdrivermanager-fat-5.0.3.jar resolveDriverFor edge (for each driver, chrome, firefox and edge)
